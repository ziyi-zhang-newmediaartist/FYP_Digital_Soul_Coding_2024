"Title: A Tale of Blue Wings and an Artist's Journey\n\nIn the bustling city of Singapore, at the start of the new decade in 2020, a striking specimen of the Morpho Menelaus species was introduced to the world at Black Crow Taxidermy & Art shop. Known commonly as the Menelaus Blue Morpho, this butterfly is hard to miss. Native to the tropical rainforests of South America, specifically Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia, they dance in the wind, flashing their iridescent blue wings edged in black. The butterfly's undersides are a dull brown, utilized for camouflage when the wings are closed, like a grand secret concealed in a mundane setup.\n\nFeeding primarily on rotting fruits, tree sap, and damp soil minerals, the Menelaus Blue Morpho is known for its territorial nature and poetic flight patterns. Not considered endangered currently, it's grappling with threats like climate change and habitat destruction. A fascinating fact is that the brilliant blue of the butterfly's wings owes its existence to tiny reflective scales, not pigmentation.\n\nThen, upon perusing this majestic creature, an Intern, fascinated by this unique creature's individuality, begins to perceive it as a symbol, that could be pivotal in his artwork. The Intern is intrigued by the unique patterns each butterfly carries, sparking queries on how this might influence his art.\n\nIn a manner that echoes the morpho's unique pattern among many, the Intern is also studying at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), a heralded institution in Singapore. Establishing its roots in 2017, NAFA presented a 3-year duration course, \"Arts Management\", a diploma program that blends arts and cultural studies with practical business administration. Here, the Intern is being equipped with knowledge and skills from esteemed faculty, preparing for careers in arts administration and cultural entrepreneurship.\n\nAs the Intern moves forward in his journey, his first impression of NAFA still lingers: the traditional design and the feeling it evokes. In this academy, rich friendships are nurtured alongside a unique opportunity to attend distinguished art events.\n\nIn the convergence of the Intern's interaction with the Menelaus Blue Morpho and his experience at NAFA, a deep philosophical concept surfaces. He sees that similar to butterflies' multitude patterns, humans, too, demonstrate a diversity of talents and strengths. He believes that the beauty in both art and life lies in an appreciation for this diversity, allowing him to weave connections between the smallest details. This belief is reflected in his creative motto \"Morphini,\" paying homage to his transformative encounter with the Morpho Menelaus and his educational journey at NAFA.\n\nThrough this tale of iridescent blue wings and an artist's journey, both the butterfly and the artist find themselves in a narrative of discovery, creativity, and profound existential contemplations that guide their lives in compelling, unexpected ways."
