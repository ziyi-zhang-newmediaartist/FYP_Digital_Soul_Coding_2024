    "abstract":"During my internship, I stumbled upon a Taxidermy shop that caught my eye with its collection of Menelaus Blue Morpho butterflies. I was immediately struck by the mesmerising beauty of these creatures. Each Menelaus Blue Morpho displayed its own distinct patterns and hues, making it truly unique. Inspired by their enchanting appearance, I envisioned incorporating the Menelaus Blue Morpho into my artistic logo, captivated by the idea of symbolising individuality and beauty."
